.        STD002FD.PBL
.
.        Defines standard includes used in all programs.  Same as STD001FD 
.        except that COMMON is defined here, the reason being that this will
.        be run standalone, and TBL doesn't let you define common variables
.        and then use them later before defining them as normal variables,
.        i.e. the data area has to be set up first.
