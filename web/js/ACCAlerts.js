"ACCIDENT DETAILS \n\n" +

"The Following are usually accepted as accidents: \n\n" +

"\u2022 A force or resistance external to the body (such as something striking the body or the body falling onto something) \n" +
"\u2022 Forceful movements of the body to avoid impact (such as ducking or twisting) \n" +
"\u2022 Environment factors (such as sudden exposure to gas or toxin) \n\n" +

"The following are not usually accepted as accidents: \n\n" +
"\u2022 Force is only from within the body (such as a sneeze causing a rib sprain, or biting the tongue) \n" +
"\u2022 Non occupational gradual process injuries (such as tendonitis developed playing tennis) \n" +
"\u2022 No specific event (such as waking up with a sore neck) \n\n" +

'As the ACC is a "no fault" scheme, injury cover and funding of treatment is not dependent on whether the injury was caused by someone (including the patient themselves). \n\n' +

"Why is it important to ACC? \n" +
'ACC must establish that the legislative criteria of an "accident" have been met in order to provide cover. \n' +
"To further understand what constitutes an accident, you refer to the ACC Legislation. \n\n" +
