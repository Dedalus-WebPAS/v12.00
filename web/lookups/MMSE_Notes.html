<p><strong>Notes on Delivery of the MMSE</strong><br />
The test was originally developed for Western Cultures and thus needs careful augmentation for non-Western societies e.g. the statement "close your eyes" signifies death in the Chinese culture. The age and level of education of the subject will also influence the test results. For example, a person with &lt;= 4 years of schooling and normal cognitive function is only expected to score 22. In general, scoring indications for the MMSE are as follows </br />

 <ul><li>24-30 - normal limits of cognition</li>
     <li>18-23 - mild to moderate cognitive impairment</li>
     <li>&nbsp;0-17  - severe cognitive impairment</li></ul></p>

<p><strong>Orientation</strong><br />
Ask for the date first. Then ask specifically for the parts omitted e.g. "Can you also tell me what the season is?"</p>

<p><strong>Registration</strong><br />
Ask the patient if you may test his or her memory. Say the names of three unrelated objects, clearly and slowly, allowing about one second for each one.  Once you have said all three, ask the subject to repeat them.  The first attempt is used to determine the score (0-3), but keep saying them until the patient can repeat all three - up to six trials.  If the subject does not eventually learn all three, then recall cannot be meaningfully tested.</p>

<p><strong>Attention and Calculation</strong><br />
If the patient cannot or will not count backwards from 100, ask him/her to spell the word "world" backwards.  The score is the number of letters in the correct order. e.g. dlrow=5 drlow=3</p>

<p><strong>Language</strong><br />
<i>Writing.</i> Give the subject a piece of paper and ask him/her to write a sentence. Do not dictate the sentence: it should be written spontaneously.  It must contain a noun and a verb and be sensible. Grammar and punctuation are not needed.<br />
<i>Copying.</i> On a clean piece of paper, draw two intersecting pentagons each side 2-3 cm long.  Ask the patient to copy it exactly.  All 10 angles must be present and two must intersect to record a positive response. Tremor and rotation are ignored.</p></td></tr>
