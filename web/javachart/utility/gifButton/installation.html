<P>gifButton is a Java applet designed to generate GIF images from JavaChart
graphs. This applet is designed primarily to overcome printing limitations
in current Java enabled browsers. These browsers (Netscape Navigator, Microsoft
Internet Explorer) do not print Java applets with other HTML page material,
nor do they allow Java graphics to be copied to a System's local clipboard.</P>

<P>To overcome this limitation, gifButton captures a JavaChart applet's
image, encodes that image in GIF format, and sends the GIF mage to your
http server. Gateway scripts on the server save the GIF image, which is
then displayed by a new browser window opened by gifButton. This image
is displayed without Java, and thus can be printed, saved, or placed on
the local clipboard for further processing.</P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">Required Software</FONT></H4>

<P>Since gifButton is based on Visual Engineering's JavaChart class libraries,
a copy of JavaChart must be installed on your target http server.</P>

<P>In addition, you need a copy of gifButton.class, GIFMaker.class and
server scripts to handle the process of saving and displaying the GIF stream
produced by gifButton.</P>

<P>This software will work only with a Java enabled browser, and an HTTP
server capable of launching perl or shell scripts.</P>

<H4><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">Details</FONT></H4>

<P>gifButton does its work by scanning the applets in its &quot;appletContext&quot;
to look for any JavaChart applets. From these applets, gifButton generates
a sequence of images to be sent the server. Since Java images start out
as 24 bit images, these are first dithered to 8 bits. Next, gifButton encodes
the image using a GIF algorithm. The resulting stream of bytes is ready
to send to a server.</P>

<P>To write the information back to your http server, gifButton uses POST
methodology, opening a socket, and writing the http header from within
the applet. Because of security restrictions in the browser's Java VM,
this transaction cannot occur with a server other than the one serving
the gifButton applet. This applet also uses the same port number used to
serve the applet to avoid contention with multiple servers running on the
same machine.</P>

<P>gifButton sends the byte stream to the document named by its &quot;saveCGI&quot;
parameter. By default, this is /cgi-bin/saveGif.cgi. Since we write a stream
of bytes to this document, it should be located in your servers scripts
or cgi-bin directory, and must perform the task of saving the bytestream
into a file.</P>

<P>Once the file is sent to the server, gifButton opens a new browser window
on the resulting GIF image. The page to open is named by the parameter
&quot;displayCGI&quot;, which defaults to an invalid address at www.ve.com.
gifButton repeats this process for each JavaChart applet on a particular
page.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">Server Scripts</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">saveCGI </FONT>- The saveCGI script simply saves
a GIF data stream originating from &quot;standard input&quot; into a file.
gifButton sets up the HTTP header information to ensure that the stream
size and type is recorded using the server's native methods (usually environment
variables). </P>

<P>saveCGI is usually a perl script that saves the gifButton output stream
into a temporary file, using the browser's IP address as a file name. We
have also provided an alternate shell script, which wites the file into
an arbitrary file name. Since this script doesn't interact directly with
the applet, you can safely modify it to suit your needs. For example, you
may want to change the directory name used for storing GIF images to another
name to prevent the potential clutter of undeleted GIF images in your script
or cgi-bin directory. Different servers use different approaches with naming
and launching script files. Most servers will launch any script located
in its cgi-bin or scripts directory, but some systems, especially NT or
Windows '95 systems, may require some modification of the script, or the
addition of a .bat file to launch the script.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">displayCGI </FONT>- This script is used to send
the GIF stream back to gifButton's new browser window. gifButton's displayCGI
parameter can be set to the location of the resulting server GIF file without
a script, but the perl script we provide also has the function of removing
the GIF file.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">Known Problems</FONT></B></P>

<P>As of this writing, gifButton does not work with Macintosh clients,
due to irregularities in Java image production. Additionally, some Java
browsers may become overloaded if gifButton is called on to produce a large
number of images.</P>

<P>gifButton's server-side scripts may need to be modified to meet a particular
server environment. Unfortunately, server resources are less uniform than
Java enabled browsers, and server-side Java is rare.</P>
