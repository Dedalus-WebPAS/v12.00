These files have been modified to implement Java 1.1 style event handling,
and have been placed with some additional files necessary for Java Beans
in a package called javachart.beans.  Please refer to this directory for
samples of using JavaChart in a pure Java 1.1 event environment.

applet.java - implements a very simple handleEvent style Dialog manager
piechartApp.java - the same as applet, but manages a piechart instead of a barchart
SimpleChart.java - extends applet.java to put this all into a main method.

*Dialog.java - various JavaChart component editors.
