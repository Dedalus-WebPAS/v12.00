<P>Network computing technologies created major changes
in the way people think of computer hardware and software. Sun Microsystem's
Java language combines an object oriented approach with machine independence
and a network centered model of computing to provide the right tools for
software professionals to usher in a new generation of computing functionality.</P>

<P>Java alone, however, is simply a powerful programming language. It requires
the imagination and effort of creative programmers and software designers
to find innovative ways to create value from this new computing paradigm.</P>

<P>Network computing and object oriented software share a common philosophical
foundation: people are far more productive when they can collaborate effectively.
Object oriented software facilitates collaboration with re-usable software
components that are easy to understand, robust enough for general-purpose
use, and easily extended to specific uses. A computer network provides
an infrastructure for sharing software components efficiently, so that
any finished product can be a collaboration of work from many talented
individuals.</P>

<P>It is in this same vein that Visual Engineering created JavaChart. JavaChart
provides graphing and charting functionality useful to almost any kind
of program. Since Visual Engineering has been doing graphics and charting
software since 1983, we are in a position to create robust, efficient,
and re-usable components. And we can share these components with
you for a tiny fraction of the cost of developing your own software. Reusable
software has become a productive reality.</P>

<P>This document provides broad overview information about the JavaChart's "chart"
package, JavaChart's predefined applets (the "applet" package), and describes
various utilities provided with this product.  Overview chapters are linked at the
top and bottom of each page, and within these chapters you will find extensive
links to the JavaChart API reference manual.  An index to this reference manual
can be found in the <A HREF="packages.html">API</A> link.

<P>A set of appendices gives general information about how to do things like
compile JavaChart programs, how to deploy classes on a web server, what are the
JavaChart class dependencies, and how to set chart properties for the standard
applets.  Since some of this information varies, depending on your target 
development and deployment environment, we recommended that you first become
familiar with using the Java language in your environment to get the most out of
this document.

<P>People vary greatly in their approaches to learning, and this product attempts
to accomodate a wide range of target users.  If you're most comfortable browsing
through source code and experimenting with already working examples, we suggest
you consult <A HREF="Appendix.D.html">Appendix D</A> to get an overview of
JavaChart's capabilities by viewing the applet demos, and then browsing the source
code located in JavaChart's standalone and applet directories.

<P>If you prefer to absorb "the big picture" before jumping into product details,
you might prefer to read through the illustrated chapter links at the top and 
bottom of this page.

<P>Experienced Java developers might want to look at the applications and applets
in JavaChart's "contrib" directory to see direct examples of subclassing and 
advanced features.  The <A HREF="packages.html">API documentation</A> is an
invaluable resource to help you understand how this code works.  We've also 
provided high level source code within JavaChart's "chart" package to demonstrate
how to assemble charting components using our predefined templates.  Experienced
developers interested in building custom charts might want to examine these java
files in the "chart" directory.
