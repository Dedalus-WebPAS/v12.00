Java class files have a standard organization and naming convention. All
class files are found beneath one of the directories or zip archives listed
in the CLASSPATH environment variable. JavaChart classes are found beneath
the "javachart" directory tree. The chart package is located in javachart/chart,
the applet package is located at javachart/applet and so on.

<P>Your applications and applets will reference classes in the chart directory
with the naming convention javachart.chart.classname.class, or will import
the entire package with a statement like:
<UL><TT>import javachart.chart.*;</TT></UL>
These files are located in javachart/chart/*.class, and the javachart directory
must be located in your CLASSPATH environment variable.

<P>An alternative is to use a zip archive that contains the JavaChart classes
you require. To use this, you would add the name of the archive to your
CLASSPATH variable instead of the directory that contains it.

<P>When you install an application that uses JavaChart, you must also install
some or all of the JavaChart class files. For your convenience, we have
supplied a zip archive that can be used for this purpose. You may not make
copies of the JavaChart API documentation to include with your software
distribution. This would violate your license to use Javachart code.

<A NAME="Spot"></A><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">Out, Damned Spot!</FONT></H4>
You've undoubtedly noticed that JavaChart's standard applets display a
small blue rectangle at the lower right hand corner of each chart. This
rectangle signals users of freeware JavaChart applets that JavaChart is
a commercial product, through the message dialog that opens with every
mouse click.

<P>As a JavaChart licensee, you can remove the spot, and disable the information
dialog in a number of ways:
<UL>
<LI>
Add the following parameter to each of your applet definitions:</LI>

<BR><TT>&lt;param name=CopyrightNotification value="JavaChart is a copyrighted
work, and subject to full legal protection"></TT>
<LI>
Or, set the default value of the boolean variable "home" in javachart.applet.ChartAppShell.java
to "true" and recompile.</LI>

<LI>
Or, subclass to override the applet's "mouseDown" method (removes dialog
box) and "drawMyStuff" method (removes the blue dot).</LI>
</UL>
Even though it's easy to remove JavaChart's default copyright notification,
you are still subject to the terms of your <A HREF="license.html">license 
agreement.</A>

<A NAME="Files"></A><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">Necessary Files</FONT></H4>
Because of JavaChart's modular construction and extensive list of supported
charts, it's unlikely that any particular chart, or even any application
or applet would require all JavaChart classes. Generally, you'll need your
application or applet, and then a JavaChart class tree that contains some
or all of the chart package, and possibly some of JavaChart's utility files
or applet classes.

<P>If you plan to use the JavaChart applets, you'll also need to be aware
of the applet requirements. Because JavaChart's applets are organized into
a package, you must include the javachart/applet directory, with ChartAppShell.class,
MessageFrame.class, and whatever applets you plan to use.

<P>If your application loads its classes from a local disk, it's a good
idea to just use the standard JavaChart archive file or the standard class
tree; either will work well. If you plan to use the applets from a browser,
however, you may want to eliminate unused classes, and create a custom
archive.

<P>The Java VM in popular browsers makes a new TCP/IP connection for each
required class. This means that an applet that contains many classes, such
as a JavaChart graph, requires many round-trips to the server just to start
up. To make matters worse, the time required to negotiate a new connection
is usually longer than the time required to download each class, so the
overall startup time for a multi-class applet can seem unreasonable.

<P>To avoid this problem, most browsers now support some kind of archive
file that can be downloaded in a single network connection. The contents
of the file are then loaded dynamically from memory. This is a tremendous
time saver because it eliminates uneeded network negotiation, but if you're
working with low bandwidth connections, it also means that you need to
eliminate unnecessary classes from your archives. For example, if you want
to build a dynamic bar chart, you certainly don't need, and probably don't
want to download classes for Speedo charts.

<P>For a complete list of all JavaChart class dependencies, see <A HREF="Appendix.C.html">Appendix
C</A>.

The Java 1.0.2 JDK supports the use of zip files without compression. You
can create these files with a number of utilities, but we've found that
public domain zip implementations generally work well. Many users have
reported problems with WinZip and with the Macintosh ZipIt utility.

<P>To put a barApp applet and its requisite files into a zip archive using
the Linux 'zip' utility, you would use a command like this:
<PRE>
<TT>zip -0r myBarArchive.zip
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/applet/ChartAppShell.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/applet/barApp.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/Chart.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/ChartInterface.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/BarChart.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/AxisInterface.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/Axis.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/LabelAxis.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/LegendInterface.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/Legend.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/Globals.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/RotateString.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/Transform.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/Dataset.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/Datum.class\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javachart/chart/Gc.class</TT></PRE>
The order of the classes isn't particularly important, but any missing
classes will throw a ClassNotFound exception.

<P>Netscape's Navigator browser versions 3 and 4 support an 'archive' flag
that will use these zip files. To use this applet on a web page, you would
use a definition like this:
<UL><TT>&lt;applet code=javachart.applet.barApp.class archive=myBarArchive.zip
height=300 width=400></TT>

<P><TT>&lt;param name...</TT>

<P><TT>&lt;/applet></TT></UL>
Unfortunately, the other major browser in wide distribution, Microsoft's
Internet Explorer version 3, doesn't support the use of zip files over
networks. It uses an alternate archive format called a "Cabinet", or CAB
file. CAB files provide an added benefit of compression, which generally
reduces the archive size by about 50%. CAB files are not supported by Navigator.

<P>For more information on creating CAB files, please consult your Microsoft
toolkit documentation. Utilities for creating and maintaining these archives
can be found on most distribution CDs for tools like Visual J++ or Developer
Network.

<A NAME="Java11"></A><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">Archives and Java 1.1</FONT></H4>
Java 1.1 confronts the archiving issue head on, implementing the more elegant
Java Archive, or jar file. Jar files include compression, and support other
features, such as identifying Java Bean compliant classes, nested archives,
and so on. A complete discussion of the jar utility is beyond the scope
of this document. Please consult the on-line documentation at JavaSoft
or refer to any of the quality publications available on Java release 1.1.

<P>Unfortunately, jar files are not supported by many browsers
in use today, but they will work with Internet Explorer version 4 and above, and
Netscape Navigator version 4 and above.  By eliminating unneeded classes and using
a jar archive, you should be able to store an entire applet in a jar file of about
50 kilobytes.  With a little bit of JavaScript, you can recognize the browser type
and meet the requirements of all Java enabled browsers, exploiting the best
compression and archiving techniques available in the latest browsers while continuing
to support earlier browsers.
