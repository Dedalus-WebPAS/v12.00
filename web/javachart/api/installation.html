<P>JavaChart is a collection of Java classes, Java source code, documentation
files and Zip archives. These files may have been downloaded from Visual
Engineering's web site, or you may have obtained the software in a variety
of media. This document assumes that you have successfully transferred
the JavaChart files to your target computer system, and that you now have
a &quot;javachart&quot; directory hierarchy, as described below. If you
have problems with this process, please contact Visual Engineering's support
staff via e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:support@ve.com">support@ve.com</A>,
or by phone at (408) 452-0600. </P>

<H4><A NAME="Required"></A><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">Required Software</FONT></H4>

<P>Like all Java development tools and applets, JavaChart always requires
a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for operation. JavaChart classes will operate
correctly with a wide range of JVMs, including those found in most popular
web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator 3.x and Microsoft Internet Explorer
3.x. Other suitable JVMs may be found in various Java Development Kits
(JDKs), and in standalone Java execution environments. </P>

<P>To recompile or modify the JavaChart classes, you'll also need a Java
compiler, such as the javac found with JavaSoft's JDK 1.0.2 or JDK 1.1.
JavaChart has also been tested with a wide range of other Java compilers,
such as Microsoft's Visual J++, Apple's JDK, Symantec Cafe, and others.
</P>

<P>JavaChart also requires access to various Java base classes and utility
classes. In particular, it makes extensive use of the Java AWT package,
the applet package, and several utility classes, such as Vector and Date.
These classes are generally a part of every Java installation. If you're
planning to use Java Foundation Classes (JFC) in lieu of AWT, please contact
your Visual Engineering representative. </P>

<H4><A NAME="Organization"></A><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">Organization</FONT></H4>

<P>JavaChart is organized into a hierarchy of directories as follows: </P>

<UL>
<P>javachart </P>

<UL>
<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">chart</FONT></I> </P>

<UL>
<P>A java package that contains the complete set of charting classes, including
classes for chart components, such as Axis, Bar, Line, etc., and complete
charts, such as BarChart, LineChart, and so on. <BR>
&nbsp;</P>
</UL>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">utility</FONT></I> </P>

<UL>
<P>Useful charting utilities, such as a class for creating a GIF output
stream from a chart. This directory also contains an &quot;app&quot; subdirectory,
which demonstrates an interactive chart editor. Complete source code is
provided, both for a standalone application as well as for an <A HREF="../utility/app/bar.html">applet
version</A>.<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
</UL>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">applet</FONT></I> </P>

<UL>
<P>A java package that contains a collection of charting applets. This
includes applets for every complete chart defined in the chart package,
as well as a charting applet superclass that reads and manages overall
charting properties from a predefined set of HTML parameters. <BR>
&nbsp;</P>
</UL>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">standalone</FONT></I></P>

<UL>
<P>A collection of sample standalone JavaChart programs that demonstrates
how to build JavaChart functionality into your own applet or application.
<BR>
&nbsp;</P>
</UL>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">api</FONT></I> </P>

<UL>
<P>Documentation for the overall JavaChart product and the chart package
classes. <BR>
&nbsp;</P>
</UL>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">contrib</FONT></I> </P>

<UL>
<P>JavaChart has been in use since December of 1995. Our users and developers
have contributed a variety of useful and interesting examples of various
charting functionality. This includes samples showing how to subclass chart
package classes for special effects, customized data parsers for our applets,
and so on. If you'd like to add to this collection, please contact <A HREF="mailto:support@ve.com">support@ve.com</A>.</P>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>To use JavaChart classes within a program, you would add the complete
path of the javachart top directory to your CLASSPATH environment variable.
This operation is performed in different ways on different operating systems.
</P>

<P>The standard JavaChart installation also includes a javachart.zip file
that contains all the chart package classes. As an alternative to adding
the javachart directory hierarchy to your CLASSPATH, you can simply add
the javachart.zip file to CLASSPATH, and operate as if you were using separate
classes. <BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<H4><A NAME="Deployment"></A><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">Deployment</FONT></H4>

<P>The class files used by your program must also be included in any deployment,
whether these are classes you reference directly, such as &quot;BarChart.class&quot;,
or classes used indirectly, such as Bar.class, Axis.class, and Legend.class,
which are all used by BarChart.class. </P>

<P>JavaChart's modular architecture means that you don't need to make every
JavaChart class available for every installation. For example, if you're
building an applet that only uses BarCharts, you don't need to include
classes for Lines, Pies, and so on. By eliminating unused classes in your
distributions, you can reduce the overall size of your application's footprint,
and significantly decrease startup times for applications loaded over a
network. </P>

<P>For more information about packaging classes for distribution, see <A HREF="Appendix.A.html">Appendix
A</A> </P>
