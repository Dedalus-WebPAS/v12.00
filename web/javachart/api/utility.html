<P>Very few utilities exist for transferring Java graphics to a clipboard
or a printer. This problem is particularly stubborn in JDK 1.0.2, which
doesn't provide a PrintJob class, and prevents client-side filesystem and
printer access. GifMaker translates a JavaChart image into a stream of
bytes with GIF encoding. This bytestream can be saved on a server, transferred
to a clipboard, or copied to any program capable of handling GIF files.
</P>

<P>A sample applet that uses this class (gifButton.class) is provided as
a valuable utility for Java 1.0.2 implementations. Together with some simple
CGI scripts (also provided) this utility will permit Navigator version
3 and Internet Explorer version 3 create printable output from JavaChart.
We've also provided some <A HREF="../utility/gifButton/installation.html">installation
and use information </A>for this utility.</P>

<P>Internet Explorer version 4 will print applets along with HTML text and images.  
Browsers that implement JDK 1.1 (IE 4 and Navigator 4) can also use JDK 1.1's PrintJob
class.  This permits you to build a user interface in your applet that will trigger
a print job from the applet.  Since the applet doesn't know anything about it's surrounding
HTML context, though, you'll only see information and graphics managed from Java.
</P>

<P>For an example of using this print utility, see PrintSample.java in the javachart.standalone
package.  To use this facility within a browser, you must also "sign" your applet.  Consult
Netscape's developer pages for an excellent discussion of applet signing.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="App"></A><FONT COLOR="#9400D3">App</FONT></H4>

<P>You may want to embed JavaChart into an application or applet that uses
interactive picking. We've provided simple charting applications that perform
these functions with both Java 1.0.2 and Java 1.1 style event management.
</P>

<P>If you're using a Java-enabled web browser to view this document, you
can try out the applet version of this facility <A HREF="../utility/app/bar.html">here
</A>or <A HREF="../utility/app/pie.html">here</A>.</P>

<P>The picking mechanism in JavaChart is adaptable to either style of event
management, as the source code samples demonstrate. Since JavaChart applets
don't provide any default event handling, you may wish to add some of the
dialog boxes included with this application to your own applets, or you
may wish to extend the dialogs for use in your own application context.
</P>

<P>In a Java 1.1 Beans development system, the Java 1.1 style application
dialogs are very easy to adapt as custom object editors or bean customizers.
</P>
