<p><font size="5">A jar of JavaChart Beans...</font></p>

<p>This jar file contains a set of beans and sample data
connectors for you to experiment with. These beans have been
tested with many popular JavaBeans development environments, with
varying levels of success. Please let us know about your
experiences.</p>

<p><strong>The Chart beans</strong>:</p>

<p>This jar contains at least 13 different kinds of charts in
bean form:</p>

<ul>
    <li>AreaChart</li>
    <li>PieChart</li>
    <li>BarChart</li>
    <li>ColumnChart</li>
    <li>LineChart</li>
    <li>RegressChart</li>
    <li>SpeedoChart</li>
    <li>StackBarChart</li>
    <li>StackColumnChart</li>
    <li>IndBarChart (one color per point)</li>
    <li>IndColumnChart</li>
    <li>DateLineChart</li>
    <li>DateAreaChart</li>
    <li>StickChart</li>
</ul>

<p>These beans each include a bean &quot;customizer&quot; for
setting the hundreds of available attributes. From the BDK
&quot;beanbox&quot;, you can select &quot;customize&quot; from
the Edit menu item to see and use the customizer.</p>

<p>The customizer permits you to interactively modify things such
as the chart's background color, 3-D effects, axis scaling and
appearance, and so on. Not all Bean IDEs support customizers at
this time, so you might not be able to see this capability in
your development tool.</p>

<p>Charts only have one standard Java property, the chart title.
Chart attributes are meant to be edited via the customizer, but
the title property serves as a placeholder for IDEs without
customizer support.</p>

<p>Some IDEs (notably VisualAge for Java) permit you to use the
customizer, but don't save the customizer data via object
serialization. In these environments, what you see is <u>not</u>
what you will get. Please consult your IDE vendor for a complete
timetable for object persistence if you run into these problems.</p>

<p>Each chart bean starts with a little bit of random sample data
to permit you to see the chart and modify data-related
attributes. Data is intended to arrive at the chart bean via
&quot;newData&quot; events, which are generated by the included
data adapter beans. If you're importing these beans into an
event-aware tool, such as JavaStudio, make sure you enable a
connector for &quot;newData&quot; events.</p>

<p>Although the entire jar file is rather large, you can reduce
footprint for each of the chart types to around 50k by
eliminating classes not needed for deployment. These include all
the files in the javachart.beans.customizer package, as well as
many of the other classes. A listing of minimal classes for each
chart type can be found at <a href="http://www.ve.com/endy/list">http://www.ve.com/endy/list</a>.</p>

<p>For deployment purposes, we've found that IE4 and Navigator 4
(with Java 1.1 patches) are best. IE4 doesn't recognize resource
paths within jar files properly, however, so if you're using any
of the Line Chart derivatives, you'll need to supply both a JAR
version and a unJar directory tree that contains JavaChart's
image markers. You also need a license to the commercial version
of JavaChart, available at <a
href="http://www.ve.com/javachart/devkit.html">http://www.ve.com/javachart/devkit.html.</a></p>

<p><strong>The Data Beans</strong></p>

<p>This jar file contains a number of data feeds that generate
JavaChart &quot;newData&quot; events. These connect directly to a
Chart bean, or to another intermediate data bean for further
refinement (DatasetReducer, DataPointReducer, etc.) Data beans
don't use a customizer, but have a number of common properties
that work with virtually all Bean-enabled IDEs. The most
important properties to be aware of are probably those that
determine whether a particular data bean will send X, Y, Label,
or Dataset Name information. You can set up some of this
information in the customizer, and if you're not careful, your
data bean will override it. For example, you might set dataset
names of &quot;apples&quot; and &quot;oranges&quot; for your bar
chart. If you enable Dataset Name information in
DataFeedSimulator, it will overwrite &quot;apples&quot; with
&quot;Dataset0&quot; and &quot;oranges&quot; with
&quot;Dataset1&quot;. The data beans include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>DataFeedSimulator - this bean generates random data at a
        specified interval and specified scale value. This is a
        useful tool for seeing how your chart will look in real
        time, and for generating a dataset similar to the one you
        expect. For example, if you want a fixed Y axis, and you
        know that your data is always in the range of 0 to
        10,000, you can simulate this data with
        DataFeedSimulator, and then use the customizer in your
        chart bean to turn automatic axis scaling off. The
        simulated data will have already created a
        &quot;reasonable&quot; axis via the data feed mechanism.</li>
    <li>RowColumnDataFeed - reads data from a specified URL at a
        specified interval. You can also read the data by rows or
        by columns.</li>
    <li>DateDataFeed - reads a specified URL that contains Date
        strings in the first column or row. This data feed
        generates data appropriate for DateLineChart,
        DateAreaChart, and StickChart.</li>
    <li>QuoteMonitorBridge - this bean accepts propertyChange
        events from the BDK's sample QuoteMonitor bean, which
        gets semi-real time stock market quotes. Connect this
        bean to DateLineChart or DateAreaChart or StickChart for
        some interesting simulations.</li>
    <li>DatasetReducer - accepts &quot;newData&quot; events from
        other data beans, and reduces the information to a single
        dataset. This is frequently useful for displaying data in
        multiple ways. For example, you might have a data feed
        that connects to a stack bar chart or area chart, which
        is ideal for displaying aggregate data in several
        categories. To look at individual groups within the data,
        however, you might prefer a pie chart, which examines a
        particular dataset. Connect your data feed to both the
        bar chart and to a group of DatasetReducer/PieChart
        combinations for this sort of display.</li>
    <li>DataPointReducer - JavaChart includes SpeedoCharts, which
        are ideal for examining a current value. DataPointReducer
        reduces a &quot;newData&quot; event to a single
        observation, and can be set to follow the most recent
        observation. You could, for example, connect the
        QuoteMonitorBridge to a LineChart, which will follow the
        price history of a particular stock, and at the same
        time, connect it to a DatasetReducer to look at a
        particular item (bid, ask, sell), and then connect that
        to a DataPointReducer to eliminate all but the last
        value, and connect that to a BarChart or a SpeedoChart to
        get an up-to-the minute snapshot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some IDEs permit you to connect JavaChart data beans with
chart beans visually, by connecting the newData generator with
the newData consumer. Others such as Sun's JavaWorkshop, don't
yet support visual event connections, and require a little bit of
code like this:</p>

<p><font face="Courier">myDataBean.addDataFeedListener((DataFeedListener)myChartBean);</font></p>

<p>Chart updating and refresh is automatic: whenever your data
source is updated, the chart is recalculated according to your
specifications and redrawn. Using the beans in this jar file, you
can trigger an update by calling the &quot;update()&quot; method
on any data bean. This can generally be done from within an IDE
by connecting a buttonPush or some other event to the data bean.</p>

<p>If you're interested in building your own data or chart beans
using this technology, please contact us at (408) 452-0600 or <a
href="mailto:support@ve.com">support@ve.com</a>. It's a fairly
simple matter to create a new data bean, which will work with all
the chart beans. It's also a simple matter to extend our standard
ChartBean superclass to support just about any kind of chart you
require.</p>
